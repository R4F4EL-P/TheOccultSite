# TheOccultSite

The project uses **node.js** and **express.js** to create a webserver.
To install the dependencies install **Node.js** first.
Then, inside the 'TheOccultSite/site' folder run the command:
```shell
npm install
```

To run the webbapp inside the 'TheOccultSite/site' folder run the command:
```shell
node index.js
```

In order to test only html pages you can use the **VS Code** extension Live Server, although some features
may not work, such as the discord login.
